#+title: LambChop - Lambdas at Runtime in C
#+author: Diego Comfort

* About
Lambda is a little project I did for fun to
1) try and make functions at runtime
2) learn more about some fun functions like ~fork()~ and
3) learn to learn from man pages

It is a header-only "library" that is purely for fun and probably
shouldn't be used seriously, but if you want to, be my guest.

* Installation
You don't need to! Just define ~LAMBCHOP_IMPLEMENTATION~ and include
the header file
#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/diegocomfort/Lambda.git
cd LambChop/
#+end_src

* Usage
** Learn it youself
See ~main.c~ for an example. Good luck!

** TODO Baby Steps
